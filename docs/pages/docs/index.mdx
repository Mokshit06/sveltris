# Sveltris

Svelte has amazing DX ...but a small ecosystem, so there are often certain libraries that are only available in React. It could also be that you want to use a Svelte library in React.

You _could_ rewrite your entire app in the other framework or **_just use_ Sveltris**

With sveltris, you can intermix UI primitives like components, and state primitives like hooks between frameworks, _without_ even noticing.

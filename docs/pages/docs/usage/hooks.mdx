# Using React Hooks

Sveltris allows you to use React hooks inside your Svelte component by wrapping the call inside `use`.

`use` returns a `readonly` svelte store that can be subscribed to by your component.

<Callout>
  The value of this store is `undefined` during the initial render, so it needs
  to be accessed inside an `#if` block.
</Callout>

```html
<script>
import { useState } from 'react'
import { use } from 'sveltris/react'

const counter = use(useState(0))
</script>

{#if $counter}
  {@const [count, setCount] = $counter}
  <button on:click={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>
    {count}
  </button>
{/if}
```

## Limitations

It has some limitations, for eg. you can't use hooks that depend on a parent `ContextProvider` being there in the react root. But if the `ContextProvider` isn't stateful then it can be passed as the second argument of `use`

# React in Svelte

With Sveltris, you can use any React component inside Svelte as if it was a regular Svelte component.

```html
<script>
  import Counter from './Counter?in-svelte';
</script>

<Counter />
```

<Callout>
The React component must be a default export for it to work. If it is not a default export, then you can create another `.js` file that re-exports the named export as a default export.

```js
export { Counter as default } from './Counter?in-svelte';
```

</Callout>

## Props and Events

Sveltris also accepts all props, and triggers a selective rerender whenever the props update. It also maps all React and custom event handlers (`/on(.*)/`) to Svelte format, and you can set them using `/on:(.*)/` syntax.
So if a component has an `onSubmit` prop, you can set it as `on:submit`

```html
<script>
  import Input from './Input?in-svelte';

  let value = '';
</script>

<Input {value} on:change={v => value = v} />
```

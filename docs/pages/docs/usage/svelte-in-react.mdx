# Svelte in React

With Sveltris, you can use any Svelte component inside React as if it was a regular React component.

```jsx
import Counter from './Counter.svelte?in-react';

<Counter />;
```

## Props and Events

You can also pass `props` and events to this component, just like in a regular React component. Updates to them automatically triggers a rerender of the Svelte component.

All svelte events such as `on:click` are mapped to camelCase like `onClick`.

```jsx
import Input from './Input.svelte?in-react';
import { useState } from 'react'

const [value, setValue] = useState("")

<Input value={value} onChange={v => setValue(v)} />;
```

## Slots and children

`children` passed to these components is set as the default slot of the underlying Svelte component

```jsx
import Layout from './Layout.svelte?in-react';

<Layout>
  <h1>Hello world</h1>
</Layout>;
```

## SSR

These components also _just work_ with SSR without any extra configuration required.
